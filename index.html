	<h2>Interaction Design (G113) (previously G103)</h2>
	<p> <b> Interaction Design is an interdisciplinary field merging design skills such as user experience, interface development and graphic design with programming to create meaningful experiences between the user, digital and physical platforms, such as websites, wearables and mobile devices.

		Modified by the psychological, social, economic and cultural factors that shape our present and future world, this ever-evolving field envisions new ways of human-computer interaction within systems, services, products and spaces across multiple industries.
		
		Throughout the Interaction Design program, students will be expected to address such topics as mixed realities, immersive environments, usability, spatial relations and human factors. An emphasis on usability testing, research, collaboration and real-world projects distinguish this program..</h2>
